/*
 * An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. 
 * Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, 
 * which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. 
 * 
 * Implement an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, 
 * and a get(index) which returns the node at index.
